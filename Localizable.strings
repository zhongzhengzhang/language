When using Lido to stake your ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain, users will receive a token (stETH), which represents their ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain on a 1:1 basis. It effectively acts as a bridge bringing ETH 2.0’s staking rewards to ETH 1.0.

wstETH is the wrapped version of stETH. The total amount of wstETH doesn’t change after users receive the token. Instead, the token’s value increase over time to reflect ETH staking rewards earned.";

Loopring will provide a pool to allow users to trade wstETH for ETH directly on Layer 2. The pool will rebalance periodically when it reaches a specific threshold. If there is not enough inventory on Layer 2, user can always withdraw their wstETH tokens to Layer 1 and swap for ETH in Lido, Curve, or 1inch.";
